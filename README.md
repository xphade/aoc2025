# Advent of Code 2025

This is my attempt to solve the challenges of Advent of Code 2025. This year
I'm trying to solve them in a couple of different languages:

 - **Professional languages**: Python, C++
 - **Forgotten favorites**: Dart, Zig
 - **New interests**: Lua

This is purely a hobby project and will probably not be completely finished,
definitely not in time for the end of AOC 2025. I'm using this as an
opportunity to practice different programming languages and problem-solving
approaches.

## Structure

Each day's solutions are organized in their own directories:

 - `day01/` - Python
 - `day02/` - Dart
 - `day03/` - Zig
 - `day04/` - C++
 - `day05/` - Lua

## Running Solutions

Check each day's README for specific instructions on how to run their
solutions.
