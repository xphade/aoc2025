# Day 4: Printing Department

This solution is implemented in C++17.

## How to Build and Run

The code was tested using Clang 17 and GCC 12. Compile the code like this:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build/
clang++ ../day04.cc -std=c++17 -O3 -o day04
# or
g++ ../day04.cc -std=c++17 -O3 -o day04
```

Then run the compiled executable with an input file, e.g.:

```bash
./day04 ../test.txt
```

It will output the solutions for both part 1 and part 2.
